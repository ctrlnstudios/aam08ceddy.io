    <p>
	Geylang was established during the early 1840s when the British Government dispersed the Malay floating village at the mouth of the Singapore River. The Malays and the Orang Laut then resettled at the mouths of the Kallang and Geylang Rivers that flowed into a common bay, known today as the Kallang Basin.
Geylang was first known as Geylang Kelapa, indicating the presence of coconut plantations back then. The initial settlers of Geylang lived in houses built on stilts over the river basin, all congregating along the river to form residential enclaves. The first Malay kampong formed was Kampong Melayu (the original name for today’s Geylang Serai).
<br><br>
By the early 20th century, Geylang had expanded into two parts separated by the Geylang River. The eastern part (Geylang Serai today) was populated by the Malays who lived in traditional houses and used the land for agriculture. The western area was divided into a series of lanes termed “lorongs”, and was mainly inhabited by the Chinese. Subsequently, these two distinct communities gave Geylang the split in the character of its population, streetscapes and building layouts.
At the turn of the century, with population growth and a housing boom, Geylang transformed from an agricultural centre into an area for speculative housing ventures.
<br><br>
Geylang also acquired for itself a name as an entertainment district. In 1936, a group of businessmen started the Happy World Amusement Park (later known as the Gay World) along Lorong 2. The main draws of the park then were its cinemas and indoor stadium. The park eventually closed in the 1970s.</p>

	Never had a Singaporean not ply along the streets of Geylang Road. The 40 <i>lorongs</i> are home to many famous delicacies in the little red dot. There were even claims by City Nomads that "If street food is a cornerstone of Singapore’s history, Geylang Road is its literal backbone" 
		  <br><br>
		
		Such includes the Michilin-starred <b>Eminent Frog Porridge</b>, <b>Leong Kee (Klang) Bak Kut Teh</b>, a 24-hour dim sum eatery in <b>Mongkok Dimsum</b> and the crowd favourite <b>Sia Kee Duck Rice</b>, etc. The list is so exhausive that we will need a full webpage and article to list them down.

		But fred not, our friend over at <a href="https://eatbook.sg/best-of-geylang/" target="new">Eatbook</a> has kindly collated a food guide for those who are interested in exploring Geylang for food!</p>

<br><br>
While most Singaporeans and tourists patron the food stalls for its unique delicacies, there are still people who will visit the little city for its vice activities. Walking along the streets of Lorong 18-20, you will be able to see few rows to bungolows lined parrellel to them. On one look, it resembles most of the other bungalows built all over the land-scarced island back in the early days. Rows of red bricked bungolows houses the majority of the legal prostitute this country has to offer.
<br><br>
It makes it extra sleazy when sexual enhancement pills can be found sold along the roads.
